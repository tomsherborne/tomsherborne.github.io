    abstract = "Recent progress in semantic parsing scarcely considers languages other than English but professional translation can be prohibitively expensive. We adapt a semantic parser trained on a single language, such as English, to new languages and multiple domains with minimal annotation. We query if machine translation is an adequate substitute for training data, and extend this to investigate bootstrapping using joint training with English, paraphrasing, and multilingual pre-trained models. We develop a Transformer-based parser combining paraphrases by ensembling attention over multiple encoders and present new versions of ATIS and Overnight in German and Chinese for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that MT can approximate training data in a new language for accurate parsing when augmented with paraphrasing through multiple MT engines. Considering when MT is inadequate, we also find that using our approach achieves parsing accuracy within 2{\%} of complete translation using only 50{\%} of training data.",

abstract = {Image captioning as a multimodal task has drawn much interest in recent years. However, evaluation for this task remains a challenging problem. Existing evaluation metrics focus on surface similarity between a candidate caption and a set of reference captions, and do not check the actual relation between a caption and the underlying visual content. We introduce a new diagnostic evaluation framework for the task of image captioning, with the goal of directly assessing models for grammaticality, truthfulness and diversity (GTD) of generated captions. We demonstrate the potential of our evaluation framework by evaluating existing image captioning models on a wide ranging set of synthetic datasets that we construct for diagnostic evaluation. We empirically show how the GTD evaluation framework, in combination with diagnostic datasets, can provide insights into model capabilities and limitations to supplement standard evaluations.},
