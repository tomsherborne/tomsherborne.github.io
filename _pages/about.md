I'm a final year PhD Candidate in the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) at Edinburgh supervised by [Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/index.php?page=index) working on low-resource approaches to cross-lingual semantic parsing. I'll be spending April - July '23 at [AI2](https://allenai.org/allennlp) in Seattle.

I'm also part of the [CDT in Data Science](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk) and [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). Previously, I was an intern at Siri Cambridge and I completed the MPhil in Computer Science at [The Computer Lab](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk) -- working with [Ann Copestake](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~aac10/) on multimodal semantics. My undergrad was at [UCL EEE](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/) -- working with [Polina Bayvel](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/people/prof-polina-bayvel) on hardware optimisation for optical signal processing.

I'm interested in multilinguality, cross-lingual knowledge transfer, structured prediction, croissants and kayaking.

_I'm on the job market_: I expect to finish my PhD near the end of 2023 and will be looking for postdoc/research scientist roles from then onwards. [Let me know](mailto:tom.sherborne@ed.ac.uk) if we can work together!
