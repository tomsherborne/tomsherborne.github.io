I'm a third year PhD student in the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) at Informatics Edinburgh supervised by [Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/index.php?page=index). I'm working on low-resource approaches to cross-lingual semantic parsing.
<!-- % and I'm also interested in multilinguality, cross-lingual knowledge transfer, structured prediction and training dynamics.  -->

I'm also part of the [CDT in Data Science](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk) and [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). Previously, I was an intern at Siri Cambridge and I completed the MPhil in Computer Science at [The Computer Lab](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk) -- working with [Ann Copestake](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~aac10/) on multimodal semantics. My undergrad was at [UCL EEE](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/) -- working with [Polina Bayvel](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/people/prof-polina-bayvel) on hardware optimisation for optical signal processing.

I'm interested in multilinguality, cross-lingual knowledge transfer, structured prediction, croissants and kayaking.

<!-- __Hire me!__   I plan to my PhD in 2023 and then I will be on the job market. [Ping me](mailto:tom.sherborne@ed.ac.uk) if you are looking for a new researcher interested in structured prediction, cross-lingual NLU and multi-lingual approaches to human-computer interfaces. -->
