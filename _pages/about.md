I'm a final year PhD Candidate in the [ILCC](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) at Edinburgh, supervised by [Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/index.php?page=index) working on low-resource approaches to cross-lingual semantic parsing. I will be submitting my Thesis by the end of January 2024, and **I am on the job market now!**

I'm part of the [CDT in Data Science](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk) and [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I have interned at [AI2](https://allenai.org/allennlp) in 2023 and Apple Siri in 2018. Previously, I completed an MSc(R) in Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, and an MPhil in Computer Science at [The Computer Lab](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk) --- working with [Ann Copestake](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~aac10/) on multimodal semantics. My undergrad was at [UCL EEE](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/) --- working with [Polina Bayvel](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/people/prof-polina-bayvel) on hardware optimisation for optical signal processing.

I'm interested in cross-lingual transfer, optimization + information geometry, croissants and kayaking.
